# UFO Sightings
An interactive webpage that displays a table of UFO sightings filtering data through an HTML form using JavaScript and D3.js </br>
The table in this webpage is dynamically based on an array of JavaScript objects, and searches data to find rows that match user input.</br>
The project can be viewed at [UFO Sightings Web Page](http://ahmedgurbuz.github.io/UFO_Sightings "UFO Sightings Web Page").
